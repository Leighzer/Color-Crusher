# Color-Crusher

This is a game I made in about half of a day. 

I wanted to make something simple, had fast controls/gave fast feed back, and was an all around complete albeit small game.


# Controls #

For each color you press a corresponding key. For now they are hard coded to s, d, and f for no particular reason except for being on the home row of a keyboard.

Press f if the color of the background is Green

Press d if the color of the background is Blue

Press s if the color of the background is Red


See how fast your reflexes are and how high of a score you can rack up!

All of the program was written by me, and the music was created by me as well.

There are 2 sound effects in the source that are not used that were obtained for free for complete free use.

# To Do #
Some of the folder names and class names in the project aren't named appropriately, and it would be nice if their names were updated to something that made more sense. Especially the form 1 class, and the source folder.
