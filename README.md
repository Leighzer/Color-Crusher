# Color-Crusher

This is a game I made in about half of a day. 

I wanted to make something simple, had fast controls/gave fast feed back, and was an all around complete albeit small game


# Controls #

For each color you press a corresponding key. For now they are hard coded to s, d, and f for no particular reason except for being on the home row of a keyboard.

Press f if the color of the background is Green
Press d if the color of the background is Blue
Press s if the color of the background is Red

See how fast your reflexes are and how high of a score you can rack up!

All of the program was written by me, and the music was created by me as well.
